## Notes
- **Package Installation**: Most frameworks are available via `pip`. Swarm and agentUniverse require GitHub cloning as they lack PyPI packages (based on typical open-source patterns). Verify package names on PyPI or GitHub for the latest setup instructions.
- **Documentation Links**: Links point to official documentation or GitHub READMEs where dedicated docs are unavailable (e.g., Swarm, agentUniverse). URLs are current as of June 2025.
- **Canvas Use**: Save as `MultiAgentFrameworks.md` in Obsidian or similar tools. Link frameworks (e.g., `[[AutoGen]]`) to detailed `.md` files for canvas visualization, or embed the table as a node.
 **Verification**: Check GitHub repositories for the latest package versions or setup steps, especially for agentUniverse and Swarm, which may evolve rapidly.
