## Notes
- **Package Installation**: Most frameworks are available via `pip`. Swarm and agentUniverse require GitHub cloning as they lack PyPI packages (based on typical open-source patterns). Verify package names on PyPI or GitHub for the latest setup instructions.
- **Documentation Links**: Links point to official documentation or GitHub READMEs where dedicated docs are unavailable (e.g., Swarm, agentUniverse). URLs are current as of June 2025.
- **Canvas Use**: Save as `MultiAgentFrameworks.md` in Obsidian or similar tools. Link frameworks (e.g., `[[AutoGen]]`) to detailed `.md` files for canvas visualization, or embed the table as a node.
 **Verification**: Check GitHub repositories for the latest package versions or setup steps, especially for agentUniverse and Swarm, which may evolve rapidly.

  - **LangGraph**: Docs at https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/ (web:3).
  - **Swarm**: GitHub README at https://github.com/openai/swarm (web:12, no separate docs).
  - **PydanticAI**: Docs at https://docs.pydantic.ai/ (prior context).
  - **agentUniverse**: GitHub README at https://github.com/alibaba/agentUniverse (web:0, no dedicated docs).
  - **Agent Squad**: GitHub README at https://github.com/awslabs/agent-squad (web:1, assumed based on AWS Labs).
  - **Bee Agent**: Docs at https://ibm.github.io/bee-agent-framework/ (web:8).
- **Table Structure**:
  - Added two columns: “Package Installation” and “Documentation Link,” placed before “Overall Review” for logical flow (installation → docs → review).
  - Kept the table concise to fit canvas rendering, with links formatted as markdown (`[text](url)`).
  - Notes section clarifies package verification and canvas use, ensuring usability in Obsidian or similar tools.
- **Release Information**:
  - Retained versions and dates from the previous response (e.g., AutoGen v0.4.0, PydanticAI v0.1.11), as no newer data is provided in search results or context.
  - Search results (web:0, web:1, web:8) confirmed active development but lacked specific version updates beyond March/April 2025.
- **Canvas Optimization**:
  - The `.md` file uses a level-1 header (`#`) and a simple table to ensure clean rendering in Obsidian’s canvas view.
  - Links in the table (e.g., `[AutoGen Docs]`) enable easy navigation or linking to other `.md` files in a canvas.
  - The notes section provides actionable guidance for canvas integration (e.g., saving as `MultiAgentFrameworks.md`).

### Integration with Canvas
In Obsidian:
1. Save the content as `MultiAgentFrameworks.md`.
2. Open a canvas (`File > New Canvas`) and drag the `.md` file into it to create a node.
3. Embed the table directly in the canvas by referencing the file or create linked nodes for each framework (e.g., `[[AutoGen]]`) with detailed notes.
4. Use the table’s links to external docs for quick access, or visualize relationships (e.g., AutoGen → CrewAI for enterprise use cases) in the canvas.
